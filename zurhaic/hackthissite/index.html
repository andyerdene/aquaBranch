              Basic test of your skills to see if you can do any of these
              missions. Requirements: HTML

            <p>
              A slightly more difficult challenge, involving an incomplete
              password script. Requirements: Common sense.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
              Some intuition is needed to find the location of the hidden
              password file. Requirements: Basic HTML knowledge
            </p>

              An email script has been set up, which sends the password to the
              administrator. Requirements: HTML knowledge, an email address
            </p>

            <p>
              Similar to the previous challenge, but with some extra security
              measures in place. Requirements: HTML knowledge, JS or FF, an
              email address.
            </p>

            /></a>
            <p>
              An encryption system has been set up, which uses an unknown
              algorithm to change the text given. Requirements: Persistence,
              some general cryptography knowledge.

            /></a>
            <p>
              The password is hidden in an unknown file, and Sam has set up a
              script to display a calendar. Requirements: Basic UNIX command
              knowledge.
            </p>

            /></a>
            <p>
              The password is yet again hidden in an unknown file. Sam's
              daughter has begun learning PHP, and has a small script to
              demonstrate her knowledge. Requirements: Knowledge of SSI (dynamic
              html executed by the server, rather than the browser)
            </p>

            /></a>
            <p>
              The password is again hidden in an unknown file. However, the
              script that was previously used to find it has some limitations.
              Requirements: Knowledge of SSI, unix directory structure.
            </p>

            <p>
              This time Sam used a more temporary and "hidden" approach to
              authenticating users, but he didn't think about whether or not
              those users knew their way around javascript...
            </p>

            /></a>
            <p>
              Sam decided to make a music site. Unfortunately he does not
              understand Apache. This mission is a bit harder than the other
              basics.
